# MotionCam Virtual File System

Update 2025 - 06 - 29

Work in Progress

Forked from https://github.com/motioncam-app/motioncam-fs

This is built with fuse2 in linux. Fuse2 is no longer actively developed, but was the basis for the Windows and MacOs fuse ports, so using to keep as similar as possible to the Windows and MacOS versions.  The newer fuse3 API has slightly different syntax.

These libraries must be installed on your linux system through your package manager in order for motioncam-fs and motioncam-player to work under linux
